## Pipeline

<img src="./assets/pipeline.png" alt="pipeline" style="zoom:100%;" />

1. **Input:** user reviews in `txt` or `csv` format, 
2. **Sentence segmentation:** Split each review into sentences using period
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Identify if a sentence is positive or negative, and split by sentiment. Used [Textblob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) 
4. **Sentence Embedding:** Embed sentences into vectors which capture the feature of sentences. Used [Infersent by Facebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent)
5. **Clustering:** Clustered embeded sentences within positive and negative groups. Used [Agglomerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html)
6. **Cluster Summarization:** To be finished
7. **Summary:** Clustered pros and cons with counts.
