"most reliable messaging app i have right now, but",0.39285714285714285,0.5178571428571428,4
it's a awesome app so who ever don't have snap chat need to have it and in a hurry,1.0,1.0,4

ite great but i want new and better filters like last year,0.3590909090909091,0.4428030303030303,6
the filters should change more often,0.5,0.5,6
it's really great but i think it need to have more filters and stikers,0.65,0.625,6
i want more filter but otherwise it is good,0.6,0.55,6
it's fun but wanted to do face swap and it's not there,0.3,0.2,7
its been 2 days and i cant even send a bitmoji cause it just keeps buffering! everything else is amazing,0.6000000000000001,0.9,7
i loved snapchat on my iphone but it's almost not worth using on my galaxy s10 plus,0.27499999999999997,0.45,8
since the last update my rear camera hasn't been focusing at all and has been very blurry which at first i thought maybe my camera had an issue but it works perfect on my phones camera,0.3625,0.425,8
would be great if this was updated for the mi mix phones so as the app flips as the camera is at the bottom of these devices (cant use filters and takes a really unflattering selfie haha),0.39999999999999997,0.4166666666666667,8
"i dont know if this is something that snapchat can fix or samsung has to fix, but i have the s10 and the camera can never focus within this app, but it does just fine on samsung's camera app",0.4166666666666667,0.5,8
idk if it's just because i run on a samsung instead of apple but yeah tons of bugs in this app ever since they changed stories from the right the original way they had it,0.33035714285714285,0.6428571428571428,8
"i use snapchat to play quick fun games with friends and to send a picture if needed, highly considering getting rid of this and just using facebook instead hopefully this gets fixed",0.22333333333333333,0.35999999999999993,9
"also, sometimes when i'm posting to my story, i can't continue to record on snapchat or my own camera until the story is posted to snapchat",0.6,1.0,9
snapchat is great and i definetly recommend it but dont update or your bitmojis will stop working,0.8,0.75,9
"people send me things that i can't view because i need to ""update snapchat from the play store"" but i don't have an update available",0.4,0.4,9
most games don't even load in group chats and i frequently get the 'update snapchat to view this message' for stickers,0.3,0.4,9
snapchat is great but after i have updated my app my stories are not visible to my some friends,0.8,0.75,9
you took something great and destroyed it,0.8,0.75,10

it has very clear pictures and it takes away the pimples on my face nd has fun paste,0.21500000000000002,0.3491666666666666,11
