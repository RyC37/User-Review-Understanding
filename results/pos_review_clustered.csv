"you're leaving a huge gap in the market and at this rate, i hope someone takes full advantage",0.375,0.7250000000000001,23
bit there is a reason why i gave it 4 stats is that you have more advanched featites on iphones,0.5,0.5,23
i say its okay becuse ive ued on my old phone ad it was okay love the filters keep it up snap chat#best app ever,0.4,0.44999999999999996,24
i really liked this app untill my filters and my games stopped working,0.6,0.8,24
updated and now i cant have my favorites as a widget/shortcut on my home screen and now inside of the app it looks like a damn comic book,0.25,0.5,24
"but really, my phone freezing on the you know that good photo that u like then while i'm editing just shut down or error message to close app",0.24814814814814812,0.362962962962963,25
"its a good app , but half of the time when i try to type on a snap photo my keyboard wont pop up and if it does it lets me type 1 letter than disappears again",0.26666666666666666,0.38333333333333336,25
i will say however the camera functionality on android seems somewhat hit or miss with certain features,0.21428571428571427,0.5714285714285714,25
"i dont know if this is something that snapchat can fix or samsung has to fix, but i have the s10 and the camera can never focus within this app, but it does just fine on samsung's camera app",0.4166666666666667,0.5,25
this is the account that i tend to write my reviews on if i even write any in the first place,0.25,0.3333333333333333,26
"if i put one in a certain place, it is moved somewhere else after posting to my story",0.21428571428571427,0.5714285714285714,26
"for whatever reason the first time i try to make videos, the sound quality is just fine",0.35555555555555557,0.41111111111111115,26
this should be the top priority to fix as i know for a fact i'm not the only one screwed over by this,0.25,0.75,26
"they should remove the ""advanced features on ar"" thing besides i am getting away from using it",0.4,0.6,26
it should be restored at any cost because it was one of the best filters snapchat ever had,1.0,0.3,26
sometimes very rarely i can close the snapchat tab and reopen it and it will work but most of the time i have to restart my phone to get it to work,0.445,0.75,27
i enjoy snapchat but when i facetime it goes really glitchyi restarted my phone and then redownloaded snapchat but it still does not work,0.30000000000000004,0.35,27
i have uninstalled and reinstalled it so many times and still the same,0.25,0.3125,27
i have changed my password so many times and still will not let me in,0.5,0.5,27
love it but if i don't have a phone number so why r they forcing me to add it,0.5,0.6,28
"i love it, but there is an issue with a message that i sent to 2 people that's not sending",0.5,0.6,28
"i love using snapchat, but i have to agree with a lot of the people here",0.5,0.6,28
i love the fact that you can text in a funny way,0.375,0.8,28
i also love the filters because you could take a picture or a video with them,0.5,0.6,28
"if am also doin video calls,i want the person m talking too to hear what am saying correctly i even realised that my phone cameral is more clean than my snapchat cameral,why? please i wnt all this fixed as soon as possible",0.24166666666666667,0.6000000000000001,29
press the the passage to read more! its good but it would be better if you had a friend and you have a other friend but you dont know her/his snapcahat name but your friend has her/his name so you can go to your friends bitmoji and scroll down and there is a button that says friends so you press it and it shows your friends friends thats that what i think you should add to snapchat,0.3088888888888889,0.4527777777777778,29
"it was perfect before but with the new update, for me, it has become laggy (sometimes my chats take up to 15s to send out and i receive the other party's snap chats in a bunch because of the lag) and it also says ""xxx sent you a message",0.3371212121212121,0.6098484848484849,29
"the camera is good but i don't get as much snapcore or filters like my friends, sometimes it gives me what i want and i like it sometimes it gives me what i don't even like, i want those very nice filters and also any time am trying to do a video its slow instead of being fast, am really not enjoying it as i had taught i would",0.22166666666666665,0.5666666666666668,29
liked the old versions better cuz now i dont even want to be on it anymore,0.39999999999999997,0.5,30
now i have to go back and find an old version of this app because snapchat does not listen to their own community,0.2333333333333333,0.39999999999999997,30
have used the app for years but when i need help there is no service available for help,0.4,0.4,30
reminds me of old snapchat and the previous update was great but might not use it as much now i just dont like going on there 👎,0.23333333333333334,0.32916666666666666,30

its really useful in my opinion,0.3,0.0,57
it just starts repeating the content of first story snap again and again,0.25,0.3333333333333333,58
