on my s10 the front camera when using snapchat is so zoomed in which makes it very difficult to take selfies,-0.65,1.0,60
why crop so close in on the front facing camera?!!!?! it looks so zoomed it it's impossible to use,-0.6666666666666666,1.0,60

whys it so laggy? and all there is to do is make stupid little filters like my best friend took her phone with her to school and we took some pics but the graphic was soo horrible i tried it out and i hav eno idea why it was a billion downloads i wish there was a way to give 0 starsü§îü§îü§îno on all questions and plus half the time every one calls it snapchat because all you do is snap a pic and chat it to friends like what rlly i hate this thing,-0.2791666666666667,0.6095238095238095,61

since the update i've had to continuously uninstall the app and it's after i've reinstalled it that i actually get it to work and that's way too annoying i preffered it before the update,-0.4,0.5,63
after that the snapchat will restart and go to the log un and sign uo and it deletes my picture i really hate it,-0.8,0.9,63
you can't respond to a picture since the update it automatically closes the thread and you have to reopen the thread to respond it's very annoying,-1.0,1.0,63
can't change the notification sound it is very annoying,-0.3,0.7,64
